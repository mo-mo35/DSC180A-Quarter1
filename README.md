Our repo contains 4 notebooks, 1 contains the generation of spike trains under main and the remaining 3 are for EDA of the IBL data we plan on using in the future, a Factor Analysis model, and the EM algorithm. Since we gathered the IBL data using the ONE api there is no need to download data locally before running the code.

To run the project simply run the following command "pip install -r requirements.txt" from the root directory of the project and then run all cells of the notebook.
